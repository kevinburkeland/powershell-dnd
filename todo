# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Clean up `utils` directory: Delete `Transform-Herbs.ps1` as it is no longer needed.
- [ ] Add Comment-Based Help to all functions (Synopsis, Description, Parameters, Examples).
- [ ] Standardize output: Use `Write-Verbose` for debug/info messages instead of `Write-Host`.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Expand Pester tests:
    - Add tests for `Start-AnimatedObjectCombat` (mocking user input).
    - Add tests for `Start-CharacterGeneration` (mocking user input).
    - Add tests for `Get-RandomHerb` (mocking user input).
- [ ] Create a `New-Character` function to separate logic from the interactive `Start-CharacterGeneration` script.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Explore adding more biomes to `herbs.json`.
- [ ] Add class and race selection to character generation.
- [ ] Create a build script to package the module.
